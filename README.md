## Discriminative analysis of features
To overcome the challenge of space limitations, we have provided a visualization analysis using t-SNE to demonstrate the discriminative power of our model's features.

## Results on Fakeddit dataset
Multimodal fake news detection is a very important topic because fake news has a profound impact on people's lives. To make a fair comparison in this field, we selected the two most commonly used datasets in fake news detection research - Weibo and Twitter. These datasets are not only widely considered standard, but also provide rich and diverse real-world examples. Additionally, we have conducted experiments on the Fakeddit dataset as well and observed significant improvements in our method over other techniques. Due to space constraints, these additional experimental results were not included in the paper, but we have provided detailed results in the online appendix.

From the table, we can observe that our method's accuracy surpasses the CAFE method by 0.022 and the MRML method by 0.094, demonstrating the superiority of our approach.
